## **Projects**

### Pool Assistant Computer Vision XR project (Best Overall Project Prize Winner at TUD Project Fair 2025)
 [![Project Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/xSxluX3aaK4/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSxluX3aaK4)
 - Uses computer vision, web sockets, and Godot, Python and GDScript to make a real-time shot predictions for pool/billiards using the Meta Quest 3 and controllers.

### Android Mobile App - Popup Chinese Dictionary
- An app for monolingual chinese word definitions that can popup on any highlighted text events in android, this allows intermediate Chinese learners the ability to improve their comprehension without breaking from their target language.
